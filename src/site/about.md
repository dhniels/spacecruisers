Hi, I’m Dave. I'm a web developer by trade, so I started Space Cruisers as a way to provide high-quality, easy to follow technical write-ups for Toyota Van owners. There isn’t a whole lot of information, parts, or aftermarket accessories for these vans available on the web. [ToyotaVanTech](https://toyotavantech.com) forum is the main resource, and while it is chock full of valuable information, it can be difficult to find what you need sometimes.

I hope I can provide a valuable resource to TV owners, whether they are skilled driveway mechanics, or have never changed their own oil. I started learning to maintain and repair my vehicles starting with my 93 Toyota Pickup and my 87 Van, and discovered a new passion in the process.
