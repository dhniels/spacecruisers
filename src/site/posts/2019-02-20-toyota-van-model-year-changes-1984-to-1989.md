The Toyota Van was introduced in the United States market for the 1984 model year. Overseas, was marketed primarily as the "Toyota LiteAce," but went by other names (depending on the market and trim) such as TownAce, MasterAce, Model F, Space Cruiser (my favorite), Tarago, and Daihatsu Delta. In the U.S., it was simply named "Toyota Van."  

Toyota marketing referred to the Van in various U.S. advertisements as the "Van Wagon" and "Wonder Wagon." This generation is also technically referred to as the R20 or R30 model.

The Toyota Van was available to consumers in three trim levels:
 - The base "DLX" trim,
 - The upscale "LE" trim,
 - and the "CRG" trim, a cargo van aimed primarily at tradesmen as a work vehicle.

For an in-depth history of the Toyota Van, refer to the [Toyota LiteAce Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_LiteAce).

**Note on the 1985 "Window Cargo Van":**

In early summer of 1984 the "Window Van" is introduced as a 1985 model year Van. These "1984-1/2" vans were identical in chassis and body to the passenger vans, the only change was a set of 60-lb plates bolted to the floorpan behind the rear wheels. Carpet and plywood cargo area flooring is found on some of these models. These vans contain the OEM second row seat mounting hardware on the floor, but not the third row seat loop, nor the third row seat belt hardware. Other than the minor mechanical changes, the 1985 cargo vans had no changes from when they were introduced during the 1984 model year as 1985 model vans.

### 1986 (4Y Engine)
Starting in 1986, the Toyota Van received an engine upgrade from the 87hp, 2.0-liter [3Y engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Y_engine#4Y) to the new 102hp, 2.2-liter [4Y engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Y_engine#4Y), as well as a minor facelift.

Other changes for the 1986 model year Toyota Van included:

	- Rack and pinion steering
	- Redesigned headlights, taillights
	- Redesigned lift gate
	- Redesigned front door panels
	- New seat fabrics
	- Refreshed color options

LE models received the following changes:

	- 5-speed manual transmission replaced by the 4-speed automatic standard
	- Third row privacy glass no longer standard on LE trim, instead made available as an option

CRG models received the following changes:

	- Windowless "Panel Van" made available
	- Rear leaf springs
	- New flat floor pan, plates removed
	- Kept the 1984-1985 taillight and lift gate style

Models with optional power windows now had the following options:

	- Integrated fog lamps
	- Second row captains chairs

## 1987
In 1987, 4WD finally came to the Toyota Van. These 4-Wheel Drive models were introduced in the LE and CRG Panel Van trims. LE 4WD models came standard with a 5-speed manual transmission, with the 4-speed automatic available as an option (2WD LE models were automatic only.) Manual locking hubs were standard, with automatic locking hubs as an option.

Changes for the LE trim:

	- New dish-styled alloy wheels on LE trim

## 1988

	- Introduced dual, heated oxygen sensors
	- Changes to ECU
	- EFI, injector/harness changes

## 1989
In 1989, the base DLX trim level was now available in 4WD, because Toyota no longer offered the 5-speed manual with 4WD models.

	- DLX trim available with 4WD
	- 5-speed manual discontinued on 4WD models
	- Keyless gas tank door
	- Improved fuel pressure regulator

## 1990 and Beyond
1989 was the final year for the Toyota Van and it was sadly discontinued in the United States due to increased competition, regulation, and safety concerns about the cab-over configuration. Toyota instead introduced an entirely new model to compete with the rise of American minivans, the Toyota Previa. The Previa shared the Van's mid-engine, rear-wheel drive configuration, but was an otherwise completely new model that had nothing in common cosmetically or mechanically with the Van. The U.S. model featured a new 2.4L 2TZ-FE engine with 135hp engine (with available supercharger - how awesome is that), a larger wheelbase, and an all-wheel drive (AllTrac) option. More information can be found on the [Toyota Previa Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Previa). Community support for the Previa, along with the Toyota Van, can be found by visiting the [ToyotaVanTech Forum](https://www.toyotavantech.com/forum/forum.php).
