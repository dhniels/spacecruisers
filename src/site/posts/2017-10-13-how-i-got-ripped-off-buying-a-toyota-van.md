title: How I Got Ripped Off Buying A Toyota Van

I got ripped off buying a Toyota Van in September of 2015.

I discovered Toyota Vans for the first time in 2014. Understand that I have a huge interest in cars. I love cars, and the older/weirder it is, the more I find myself drawn to it. Add a Toyota emblem and you have me sold immediately. I&#8217;ve been a lifelong fan of Toyota vehicles &#8211; my first car was a 1993 Toyota Camry (graciously &#8220;loaned&#8221; to me by my parents) when I turned 16 years old. After a short time driving the Camry my dad picked up the aptly named 1993 Toyota &#8220;Pickup.&#8221; I drove that through most of high school, and had a few flings with other cars including a 4WD Honda Civic Wagon, 2-door soft top Geo Tracker, Mazda Miata, Subaru Impreza, and Suzuki Sidekick Sport. The Pickup always remained there, unflinching and reliable, in spite of its status as a little 2-wheel drive work truck. It obtained a few scrapes and the truck bed had bowed from hauling huge loads of gravel (weights which I&#8217;m sure exceeded its ratings) but alas, it remained loyal to me and stuck around for several years until I bought it from my dad. With only 130k miles on the ticker, it still had another 20 years in it.

*In case you’re wondering, yes, this photo does invoke a twinge of sadness…*

Then the day came. After putting a bunch of time into the pickup making some improvements including building out a camper/sleeping platform in the bed, I stumbled upon the Van. I had been wanting one after driving my brother-in-law Cameron&#8217;s VW Vanagon and falling in love with the bus-style front cabin, the roominess and versatility of the cabins interior. However, being diametrically opposed to anything German, and especially that bearing the &#8220;VW&#8221; nameplate I scoffed in disgust at the thought of buying one. &#8220;It&#8217;s too bad Toyota didnt make something like this,&#8221; I mused. Imagine the delight when I found out&#8230; _they did_. I did the unthinkable and betrayed Babe, my trusty blue pickup steed and sold it in favor of a Van.

_(Side note: I love how Toyota simply named their vehicles &#8220;Pickup&#8221; and &#8220;Van&#8221; &#8211; they say simplicity is the ultimate sophistication right?)_

I had no idea what I was getting myself into.

The kid selling it was a recent high-school grad who had taken the van to Moab. You can see the video on YouTube below:

This video was what pushed me over the top in my desire to have one of these. After hounding classifieds across the country for almost a year looking for one however, the fact reminaed that I had next to zero mechanical knowledge of these vans, and my experience working on cars was limited only to the very few items I had fixed on my Pickup (the thing never broke! Ever!) So after driving it around, seeing the kid&#8217;s passion for the van, and meeting his dad who was a mechanic and owned a local shop, I made the terrible assumption that it had been well taken care of. I was wrong. They say that mechanic&#8217;s cars are always the most neglected and I learned first-hand that is so true.

*For the price I paid, I should’ve insisted he include the antlers…*

I paid $5,000 for what I thought was a meticulously cared for vehicle with a few small rust spots and happily drove the van home from Salt Lake City to St. George with the radiator light on (the seller dismissed it as an &#8220;electrical bug&#8221;) and without once checking the oil level (the seller said it burned oil but he had just filled it.) Upon arriving home in elation, I started inspecting things and thats when the nightmare began. I checked the coolant overflow tank &#8211; empty. Uh oh. I filled it up and the radiator light went off. &#8220;Oh no,&#8221; I thought. &#8220;This kid had no idea what he was talking about.&#8221; I immediately followed by checking the oil level which was nearly bone dry. Yikes. I filled that up as well and realized that I had just bought a van that should have only been worth $1,000. The nightmare had begun.

*After seeing how truly dilapidated it was, I consoled myself with a wash*

Over the next year, going through unemployment, moving to Washington state and then back to Utah again a few months later, I tried my best to give the Van the attention it needed. I fixed things here and there, and slapped down some big bills to address some other big issues I hadnt noticed like a leaky radiator (a $700 job to recore and replace). All the while I struggled to remain positive. I have literally poured &#8220;blood, sweat, and tears&#8221; into this thing. I don&#8217;t have a lot to show for it cosmetically (I plan to address this), but mechanically its a night and day difference, and I&#8217;ve learned a staggering amount about myself and about working on cars that has been well worth the dollar price I paid. Not only that, but we&#8217;ve been able to have a few memorable camping trips in it and caught the &#8220;Van Life&#8221; fever. I have a plethora of ideas and improvements for the future, and dream daily of epic road trips and campouts that would only be possible with a vehicle of its character.

This massive ripoff was one of the best purchases I ever made.
