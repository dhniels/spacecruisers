I&#8217;ve decided to compile a list of the torque specs for common components on the van as a quick reference guide. If you see anything missing that needs to be added, shout out in the comments!

If you don&#8217;t already own a torque wrench and sockets, I use and can advocate for Tekton&#8217;s torque wrench (and all their tools in general.) Tekton covers all their tools with a lifetime warranty! Plus Amazon has always been great about returns in my experience.

**Tools**

* [3/8-inch drive torque wrench](http://amzn.to/2CSh82j) (I own and use this tool)
* [1/2-inch drive torque wrench](http://amzn.to/2GX5c1z) (for bolts requiring more than 80 ft. lbs.)
* [1/2-inch drive digital torque wrench](http://amzn.to/2tfSVn5) (in case you&#8217;re feeling fancy)
* Socket set ([3/8&#8243; regular](http://amzn.to/2t7Q0MS) or [3/8&#8243; deep](http://amzn.to/2t9Thv5); [1/2&#8243; regular](http://amzn.to/2oDknGk) or [1/2&#8243; deep](http://amzn.to/2tamq9x))
