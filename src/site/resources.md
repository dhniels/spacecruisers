## Web Hosting

Since I am a web developer, I use static site generators and host my sites at [netlify](https://netlify.com). However, BlueHost provides cheap, Wordpress friendly hosting that allows you to set up your own website or blog in minutes. I have used them in the past for other projects and they make buying a domain, setting up a website, creating a custom email, and publishing to the web very easy. [Sign up at BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/dhniels/SpaceCruisers) to get started.


## Amazon Prime

I have been a subscriber to Amazon Prime for several years now. I use Amazon for almost all my parts and accessories orders, as well as tools. I use a lot of Tekton tools and have been impressed with their quality and their lifetime warranty. Buying products on amazon using the links on the site is a great way to support the development of more content.

## Coinbase

I have been a Bitcoin investor for several years, and it has been a very exciting and innovative area. I love paying and getting paid in bitcoin. Just like the internet democratized the creation and sharing of information, cryptocurrency has the ability to democratize the creation and sharing of wealth. Coinbase is an excellent, user-friendly way to get started, even if you donâ€™t know anything about cryptocurrency. [Sign up for Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/51daf261b0ab335d59000039) to get started, and we each earn $10 free.

## Brave Browser & Basic Attention Token (BAT)

Visit the site in [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/cru410) and Brave will pay out publishers of your favorite sites in their new cryptocurrency token, BAT. Using Brave is a great way to pay out to your favorite sites (including this one) in BAT tokens and keeps the site ad-free!
